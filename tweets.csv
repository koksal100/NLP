It‚Äôs also important to remember that what took place today at the Olympics happens every day to Muslim women forced to live under sharia law. Like Angela Carini, Muslim women get punched and beaten by their husbands while the world stands by and allows it. 

To every single feminist and woman who supports this crime against nature and does not speak up against it, you represent everything that is wrong and broken in our society. 

No woman should ever need to compete against a man in a woman‚Äôs sport, especially not in a sport like boxing. No woman should ever be allowed to be left helpless and beaten by their husbands because of a cult or religion they‚Äôre forced to live under. It defies all logic that this is happening in 2024.

 The jump that got her the Olympic ticket is one of the best jumps ever in the NCAA. Done at the Hayward Field in Eugene, Oregon

Dikec competed in the 10m air pistol mixed team event, where he and his teammate Sevval Ilayda Tarhan secured a silver medal for Turkey. What caught the attention of many was Dikec's casual and gearless style during the competition.

In contrast to his competitors who were equipped with specialized gear including goggles, lenses to prevent blur, and ear protectors for noise reduction, Dikec was seen competing with one hand in his pocket and minimal gear. This nonchalant approach not only won him the silver medal but also made him an internet sensation.

Commenting on his viral fame, Dikec said, ""I did not need special equipment. I'm a natural, a natural shooter."" This statement not only reflects Dikec's confidence in his skills but also highlights his unconventional approach to shooting. His performance and style have captivated social media, making him a standout figure of the Paris Olympics 2024."

Also, POTS is a syndrome triggered by underlying conditions. Depending on the trigger, POTS can be more debilitating and last longer for some individuals than others.

426,34,107,590,65,37373,@marouane53,Marouane A. Lamharzi,5s,"Lots of talk about Algerian boxer Imane Khelif at the Olympics. Time to clear up some misconceptions.

First off, Khelif isn't unbeatable. She's lost 9 fights and had 4 draws out of 50. At the Tokyo Olympics, she placed 4th. Good, but not dominating.

Khelif might be intersex or have hyperandrogenism. Basically, her body produces more testosterone than typical for women. It's a natural variation.

Last year, she was disqualified from World Championships due to XY chromosomes. But biology isn't simple, you can have XY chromosomes and still develop as a woman.

Important context: Khelif is from Algeria, where LGBTQ+ identities are criminalized. The idea that they'd knowingly send a trans athlete doesn't make sense.

Khelif's been competing as a woman her whole career. This isn't a case of someone switching categories to gain an advantage.

The real issue here is how sports organizations deal with natural biological variations. There's no easy answer.

Some people are using this to attack the LGBTQ+ community, but that's misguided. Khelif's case is about intersex athletes, not trans athletes.

The online hate and bullying Khelif's facing is brutal. Imagine having your identity questioned and attacked on a global stage, just for being yourself. That's gotta be devastating.
And whatever your stance on the sports policy debate, remember Khelif's a real person dealing with intense scrutiny and cruel comments. 

A little empathy goes a long way."

Contrary to the vile disinformation being spread online, there are no trans women competing in boxing at the Olympics. 

In fact, there are no trans women competing at all in the Olympics. None. Zilch.

There are two non-binary athletes competing who were assigned female at birth: track and field star Nikki Hiltz (U.S.) and soccer star Quinn (Canada).

There is one trans man competing (that means he was assigned female at birth): Hergie Bacyadan (Philippines), who became the first trans man to ever compete at the Olympics. He was soundly defeated by unanimous decision in the first round of women‚Äôs boxing by China‚Äôs Li Quan.

I take pride in all of these athletes who are breaking barriers, and it‚Äôs completely disgusting to watch insecure and hateful men on this site spread lies and half-truths about trans athletes.

My congratulations to Ms. Quan on her resounding victory, to Mr. Bacyadan for his historic accomplishment in qualifying for the Games, to Hiltz and Quinn for their representation on the highest stage, and to every athlete living up to the highest standards of competition and character.

Angela Carini lasted only 46 seconds against her transgender male opponent Imane Khelif at the Olympics.

#IStandWithAngelaCarini is now trending across the globe as people are outraged at what they witnessed.

It is an atrocity that transgender men are competing in women‚Äôs sports.

The absurdity has been on full display at this Olympics. Women‚Äôs lives are endangered now. Kids are receiving the message loud and clear‚Ä¶it‚Äôs okay for men to beat up women.

Mike Tyson has come out saying he'll fight the Olympic DUDE and donate all proceeds to a battered women's charity.

Transgender ideology has seeped into every area of society. The Paris Olympics is a warning, it reveals the utter failings of religion and Western countries‚Äô collapse.

The world is turning into Sodom and Gomorrah. There's no hiding it. Since the Olympics Opening Ceremony, Sodom and Gomorrah have been two of the most searched words.

The whole transgender deception has overridden God‚Äôs common law.

THE SOLUTION:
I‚Äôm calling for the NZ government to legislate ASAP that there are only two genders
1. A biological male (man)
2. A biological female (woman)

When you legislate that there are only two genders, it cleans up a whole lot of this nonsense, including:
 No trans men competing in women‚Äôs sports
 No puberty blockers
 The RSE guidelines in school are no longer relevant
 No more trans men in women‚Äôs spaces‚Ä¶bathrooms, changing rooms, dressing rooms
 No more drag queens reading to kids in libraries

The NZ Police are now training officers that it‚Äôs a Hate Crime to say that there are only two genders. They are preparing to protect this dysfunction in our countries. There is no such hate crime law that will permit this. 

I believe every country in the world should be doing this‚Ä¶legislating that their are only two genders!

The safety of our children, families, and our countries is at stake here. This rainbow ideology is destroying our societies and economies.

It all comes down to money. Rainbow money has taken over the world. Money, is why the IOC allowed this trans madness to occur. They don‚Äôt want to upset the woke companies that sponsor their games. They don‚Äôt care that they upset the millions of viewers worldwide. They only care about the money.

DEI is ruling our world, and I won‚Äôt stand for it!

These Olympics have been an absolute failure and embarrassment from the beginning.

Join me as we continue to fight for only two genders.

I watched the 4th quarter of the semifinal Croatia vs Russia and the gold medal game USA vs Croatia.

Croatia was NO pushover. 

Drazen Petrovic led ALL scorers with 28 against Russia and 24 against USA 

Toni Kukoc led ALL playmakers in both games at 7 assists and then 9 (hitting a deep clutch 3 with a defender in his face with 30 seconds left in the semis)

At one point Drazen even pushed MJ and was talking trash with him face to face. Something most NBA guys wouldn‚Äôt dare to do. 

Croatia was a better 3 point shooting team than the dream team! Shooting 9/17 (52.9%) while the USA shot 5/13 (38.5%)

I removed it because, as many rightfully pointed out, it was speculative and lacked hard evidence one way or another. 

The excellent points made by those who commented make a few things clear:

1. We need full transparency regarding medical factors that may confer unfair advantages in all sports, in particular women‚Äôs sports. 

2. We likely need special rules to handle rare situations, including erring on the side of limiting who can play against women. 

3. There‚Äôs widespread support for keeping biological men out of women‚Äôs sports, for many good reasons. 

Women have fought for many years to achieve competitive athletic opportunities that begin to approach what men have enjoyed forever. This isn‚Äôt the time to erase those gains plus put women at physical risk."

 on her incredible victory, winning the all-around Olympic gold medal! I‚Äôve loved watching Simone‚Äôs journey over the years. It‚Äôs not just her incredible and now record-breaking performance ‚Äî becoming the most decorated female Olympic gymnast of all time ‚Äî but how she‚Äôs done it and the role model she‚Äôs become. After withdrawing from the 2021 Tokyo Olympics, she prioritized her physical and mental health and then returned very much on her own terms. That‚Äôs a medal-worthy achievement of its own. As she says, ‚ÄúIf it's not your decision, you're not having fun‚Ä¶ If you're having fun, that's when the best memories are built.""

There are calls all across the media and social media for Imane Khelif to be banned from the Olympics despite the fact that she is neither transgender nor a man.

The argument?

Elevated testosterone.

Their argument has now gone from ‚Äúbiological reality‚Äù to ‚Äúbiological reality within bounds that we believe to be acceptable.‚Äù

Now this starts to raise some questions in my mind.

Would Imane Khelif be excluded from single-sex spaces because of raised testosterone levels? How would you know?

What else would she be excluded from on the basis of a raised testosterone level? What about other women who have raised testosterone levels on the back of PCOS, Hirsutism, CAH, Cushing‚Äôs Syndrome, peri-menopause or the range of other physiological causes for raised testosterone levels?

Would these women face the same scrutiny and exclusion? Would they be subjected to invasive testing and discrimination because their natural hormonal levels do not fit within a narrow, arbitrary definition of ‚Äúacceptable‚Äù femininity?

This kind of thinking doesn‚Äôt protect women; it polices and punishes them for their natural variations that they have literally no control over. It undermines the very concept of biological diversity and ignores the complex realities of human physiology, which is something that the Gender Critical Theory in its base simplicity just does not take into account. 

Gender Critical Theory is not about protecting women‚Äôs spaces, it‚Äôs never been - it‚Äôs only ever been about enforcing a narrow, prejudiced view of what a woman should be with a nice dollop of Transphobia to justify it."

The U≈°ƒáe Sports Society from Belgrade, Serbia, has decided to honor Italian female boxer Angela Carini with a gold medal. This recognition comes after Carini faced Imane Khelif of Algeria at the Paris Olympics. According to Gazzetta dello Sport, Carini abandoned the match after just 46 seconds, citing difficulty breathing following powerful punches to her face.

The society lauded Carini's bravery and determination to compete in the Olympics under challenging circumstances. They believe her actions have earned the admiration of many, recognizing her as a champion in the truest sense of sportsmanship. The U≈°ƒáe Sports Society's gesture of sending Carini a gold medal symbolizes their unwavering support and acknowledgment of her as a true champion during this trying time."

So I did some digging. And so far here‚Äôs what I‚Äôve got:

‚ÄúIs Imane Khelif intersex?‚Äù 
Almost every article I‚Äôve read (& I‚Äôve opened up about 20+ at this point) essentially says ‚ÄúImane Khelif has never identified as trans or intersex‚Äù. They never get more specific than that. 
EVERY SINGLE NEWS ARTICLE I‚Äôve read doesn‚Äôt confirm her gender, nor specifies what condition she might have. The only places where I‚Äôve heard she‚Äôs trans, or female, or has some condition, or anything else is from Twitter.

‚ÄúIf Khelif is not a biological male, what‚Äôs the problem with her competing?‚Äù 
Khelif failed a gender test done by the IBA (International Boxing Association) for the 2023 World Boxing championship. All articles I‚Äôve read say she failed the test because of elevated testosterone levels, because she has XY chromosomes, or both.

‚ÄúIf she failed gender tests in the World Boxing championship, why can she box the Olympics?‚Äù 
Because the Olympics doesn‚Äôt listen to the IBA. They do their own tests, & claim Khelif passed those tests.

‚ÄúIf Khelif is biologically female, why does she have elevated testosterone levels & XY chromosomes?‚Äù
Despite no actual news article specifying why this might be, I‚Äôve found multiple non-news articles that say she has ‚ÄúHYPERANDROGENISM‚Äù, a condition when present in females produces high levels of testosterone & XY chromosomes.

That‚Äôs all I got. Hope this helps. I guess."

1333,216,72,648,52,93549,@farzyness,Farzad,9s,"Re: women's Olympic boxing match that's taken the internet by storm.

The question isn't about trans athletes competing in sports in this specific scenario - it's about a person that was born with female genitalia but with an XY chromosome, like a man would've.

This has given the person in question a visible advantage in the things that matter most in sports - larger frame, more muscle mass, and in things that can't be seen with higher testosterone and other factors.

Putting aside what the right gender it is to call this person, in the spirit of fair sport, what happened today doesn't represent fairness IMO.

Sports are highly regulated for a reason - to maximize fairness between combatants and to minimize the chance of injury or death due to unfair advantages.

This is why I do not support the cross-over of people born as men - strictly speaking XY chromosome with male genitalia - that choose to transition and compete as women.

This has given them unquestionable advantages that are simply not fair. I think these folks should either compete in their own league of transgender athletes, or in the league that they were born in.

However, in this specific scenario, as long as the above is true, it's a little bit more complex. In the end the question is around fairness.

At first glance it does not feel to me that a person born with an XY chromosome, which ends up getting all the advantages of said chromosome in sport, should be allowed to compete in women's sports.

Men have natural advantages vs women when it comes to physical attributes - muscle mass, size, reaction speed, twitch muscles, etc. The XY vs XX chromosome is the best tool we have to decide who will get these benefits.

I think what gender this person should be referred as is a much less important issue, and I don't think it's a big deal if this person wants to be referred to as a woman due to the genitalia she was born with. This is a non-issue IMO.

However, safety and fairness in sport is much more important, and in rare cases like these, it's important to ensure we have a level playing field.

Some might bring up the example of natural freaks like Mike Tyson in his prime - he was dominating absolutely everyone in his weight class and was a physical freak of nature.

The important distinction here is that Mike Tyson had the same chromosome make up as the rest of the field and very likely had the same level of testosterone. Within the bounds of what he was born with, he excellent above everyone else.

In this case, there's a natural advantage that doesn't exist in the rest of the field and is impossible to access if you are born with a XX chromosome - unless you partake in some serious illegal activity by using Performance Enhancing Drugs.

That's my take - tell me where I'm wrong."

In March 2023, Khelif was disqualified for failing to meet eligibility criteria shortly before her gold medal bout at the 2023 IBA Women's World Boxing Championships. 

The Algerian Olympic Committeesaid Khelif was disqualified for medical reasons. It was later reported that the disqualification was due to high levels of testosterone.

According to International Boxing Association president Umar Kremlev, DNA testing of Khelif and other athletes ""proved they had XY chromosomes and were thus excluded from the sports events""

There is speculation that Khelif may not be transgender but has a disorder of sex development (DSD), which causes some females to have XY chromosomes and blood testosterone levels typical of a male.

If she couldn‚Äôt qualify at the World Championships, I don‚Äôt believe she should in the World Olympics but she isn‚Äôt a man, as for Angela Carini, she was robbed but she has also been crying since 2021.

But ""sex assigned at birth"" is another ideological term that does not always reflect a persons actual sex. Some people are born with DSDs that may cause a doctor to mistakenly ""assign"" a newborn the wrong sex. Based on gender ideology, if these people grow up and ""identify"" as the sex that was incorrectly recorded on their birth certificates, they will be ""cis.""

Because gender ideology is completely detached from reality, the term ""cis woman"" does not necessarily mean ""female.""

So everyone saying that the male boxer currently beating up women in the Olympics is a ""cis woman"" needs to stop using these misleading ideological terms and actually focus on material reality. 

The boxer is biologically male, and ideological word games do not change that fact."

Since her match in the Paris Olympics a lot of misinformation has been spread so let me clarify a few things. 

She has hyperandrogenism, a condition marked by unusually high levels of androgens in her blood, resulting in elevated testosterone and the presence of XY chromosomes.

Algeria, being a Muslim country without LGBT rights, would never send a trans person to represent them.

Rosario Coco, president of the Gaynet communications association, clarified: ""Contrary to circulating reports, Algerian athlete Imane Khelif is not a trans woman. Based on our information, she is an intersex person who has always identified and socialized as a woman and has a history of competing in women's sports.""

1759,127,128,769,40,120499,@nexta_tv,NEXTA,11s,"Italian boxer Angela Carini says 'I quit to save my life' after stopping Olympics bout with 'biologically male' opponent Imane Khelif just 46 seconds into first round

The clash between Angela Carini and her Algerian opponent Imane Khelif lasted just 46 seconds, with Carini yelling 'this is unjust' before she fell to canvas.

Khelif was thrown out of last year's world championships after failing testosterone tests carried out to establish gender qualification.

But despite her gender test problems, she was admitted to the Olympics. 

Olympics officials at Paris 2024 have accepted her as a female and state so in her official games biography.

The fight is now set to become one of the most controversial in Olympic history.

Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni expressed disagreement with the International Olympic Committee's decision to allow Khelif into the Olympics: ‚ÄúFrom my point of view, it was not a competition of equals,‚Äù La Gazzetta dello Sport quoted Meloni as saying."

Angela trained for YEARS like any other top tier athlete to have a shot at the Olympics. And it was her dream, dedicated to her late father.

I think she not only has an immense spirit but also she made the right decision in a split second. She got hit HARD, she knew the fight was already unfair, she decided in an instant that severe brain damage, or something worse, was not worth it. Her father wouldn't have wanted that for her.

So yes, boycotting works. But don't put ALL responsibility on the athletes. It's easy to just type that from your couch. You're not the one who has gone through the insane training, especially in boxing. 

You know what works? stop voting for communists. Stop voting for woke 'tolerance!' gaslighters. Stop giving power to people with sadistic ideologies. They have started this mess, and the bad news are that it's going to get worse, unless we do something to stop them."

Khelif is not a biological man, she is a woman with a high level of testosterone and was disqualified from the world championship last year due to concerns over that matter and failing to meet the eligibility criteria. She does not have the XY chromosomes instead of XX as the circulating claims.
Her case is similar to South Africa‚Äôs middle-distance runner and two-time Olympic gold medalist Caster Semenya (2012 & 2016) who has had a high level of testosterone in her body and was subjected to tough rules from the IOC to take testosterone-reducing medications and was banned from some races until she meets the allowed level. Please do read about Semenya if you have no clue about her story.
There has been a dispute between the IOC and the World Boxing Association regarding the participation of Khelif and Lin Yu-ting of Taiwan who has a similar case at #Paris2024
The talks should be about whether she is allowed to compete or not due to the high level of testosterone and not accusing her of being a man.

For a long time I've been annoyed at the Hollywood portrayal of the bad-ass fighting woman. Women as small as Scarlett Johansson are shown being able to physically defeat men three times her size. 

The debacle of this week's Olympic boxing match between a man and a woman reveals the lie: even an average-trained man can destroy an elite-trained woman in physical combat. 

This is why it's an age-old custom in almost every culture in history that a man should never hit a woman, and that women should not be engaged in physical combat of any kind. 

Woman are to be protected by men, not assaulted by them.

But by Hollywood creating the illusion that women can fight as well as men, we've led men to think that it's okay to hit women, and we've led women to think they can just as good as men in combat situations.

I feel nothing but sympathy for the poor woman who was assaulted by a man at the Olympics, but I have nothing but disdain for the Hollywood degenerates who have promoted the idea that fighting is something women can and should do."

1991,31,393,2195,216,56355,@terfnurse,LetaLeStrange,12s,"Let me make this really easy for everybody: Men with disorders of sexual development are NOT WOMEN. They are unusual men.

I presume that the male boxers competing against women in the Olympics have alpha 5 reductase or some similar partial androgen insensitivity syndrome. That does not make them female, that makes them unusual males.

There are people who have complete androgen insensitivity sensitivity syndrome, who frequently think that they are female until puberty hits. I mean no disrespect to people with CAIS when I say this, and I hate that you have been drug into a vicious political debate, but they are not women. They are *highly unusual* men.

Every human being who has ever walked the earth is either male or female. The fact that unusual males and unusual females exist does not mean that there is some mystical magical third thing. There is not. Mammalian sex is present from the time of conception and cannot be changed. A developmental pathway can be interrupted, unusual, or disrupted, but it cannot be changed. 

Hope this helps."
