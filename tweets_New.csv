First off, Khelif isn't unbeatable. She's lost 9 fights and had 4 draws out of 50. At the Tokyo Olympics, she placed 4th. Good, but not dominating.

Khelif might be intersex or have hyperandrogenism. Basically, her body produces more testosterone than typical for women. It's a natural variation.

Last year, she was disqualified from World Championships due to XY chromosomes. But biology isn't simple, you can have XY chromosomes and still develop as a woman.

Important context: Khelif is from Algeria, where LGBTQ+ identities are criminalized. The idea that they'd knowingly send a trans athlete doesn't make sense.

Khelif's been competing as a woman her whole career. This isn't a case of someone switching categories to gain an advantage.

The real issue here is how sports organizations deal with natural biological variations. There's no easy answer.

Some people are using this to attack the LGBTQ+ community, but that's misguided. Khelif's case is about intersex athletes, not trans athletes.

The online hate and bullying Khelif's facing is brutal. Imagine having your identity questioned and attacked on a global stage, just for being yourself. That's gotta be devastating.
And whatever your stance on the sports policy debate, remember Khelif's a real person dealing with intense scrutiny and cruel comments.

Contrary to the vile disinformation being spread online, there are no trans women competing in boxing at the Olympics. 

In fact, there are no trans women competing at all in the Olympics. None. Zilch.

There are two non-binary athletes competing who were assigned female at birth: track and field star Nikki Hiltz (U.S.) and soccer star Quinn (Canada).

There is one trans man competing (that means he was assigned female at birth): Hergie Bacyadan (Philippines), who became the first trans man to ever compete at the Olympics. He was soundly defeated by unanimous decision in the first round of women’s boxing by China’s Li Quan.

I take pride in all of these athletes who are breaking barriers, and it’s completely disgusting to watch insecure and hateful men on this site spread lies and half-truths about trans athletes.

My congratulations to Ms. Quan on her resounding victory, to Mr. Bacyadan for his historic accomplishment in qualifying for the Games, to Hiltz and Quinn for their representation on the highest stage, and to every athlete living up to the highest standards of competition and character.

Angela Carini lasted only 46 seconds against her transgender male opponent Imane Khelif at the Olympics.

#IStandWithAngelaCarini is now trending across the globe as people are outraged at what they witnessed.

It is an atrocity that transgender men are competing in women’s sports.

The absurdity has been on full display at this Olympics. Women’s lives are endangered now. Kids are receiving the message loud and clear…it’s okay for men to beat up women.

Mike Tyson has come out saying he'll fight the Olympic DUDE and donate all proceeds to a battered women's charity.

Transgender ideology has seeped into every area of society. The Paris Olympics is a warning, it reveals the utter failings of religion and Western countries’ collapse.

The world is turning into Sodom and Gomorrah. There's no hiding it. Since the Olympics Opening Ceremony, Sodom and Gomorrah have been two of the most searched words.

The whole transgender deception has overridden God’s common law.

THE SOLUTION:
I’m calling for the NZ government to legislate ASAP that there are only two genders
1. A biological male (man)
2. A biological female (woman)

When you legislate that there are only two genders, it cleans up a whole lot of this nonsense, including:
 No trans men competing in women’s sports
 No puberty blockers
 The RSE guidelines in school are no longer relevant
 No more trans men in women’s spaces…bathrooms, changing rooms, dressing rooms
 No more drag queens reading to kids in libraries

The NZ Police are now training officers that it’s a Hate Crime to say that there are only two genders. They are preparing to protect this dysfunction in our countries. There is no such hate crime law that will permit this. 

I believe every country in the world should be doing this…legislating that their are only two genders!

The safety of our children, families, and our countries is at stake here. This rainbow ideology is destroying our societies and economies.

It all comes down to money. Rainbow money has taken over the world. Money, is why the IOC allowed this trans madness to occur. They don’t want to upset the woke companies that sponsor their games. They don’t care that they upset the millions of viewers worldwide. They only care about the money.

DEI is ruling our world, and I won’t stand for it!

These Olympics have been an absolute failure and embarrassment from the beginning.

Join me as we continue to fight for only two genders.

There are calls all across the media and social media for Imane Khelif to be banned from the Olympics despite the fact that she is neither transgender nor a man.

The argument?

Elevated testosterone.

Their argument has now gone from “biological reality” to “biological reality within bounds that we believe to be acceptable.”

Now this starts to raise some questions in my mind.

Would Imane Khelif be excluded from single-sex spaces because of raised testosterone levels? How would you know?

What else would she be excluded from on the basis of a raised testosterone level? What about other women who have raised testosterone levels on the back of PCOS, Hirsutism, CAH, Cushing’s Syndrome, peri-menopause or the range of other physiological causes for raised testosterone levels?

Would these women face the same scrutiny and exclusion? Would they be subjected to invasive testing and discrimination because their natural hormonal levels do not fit within a narrow, arbitrary definition of “acceptable” femininity?

This kind of thinking doesn’t protect women; it polices and punishes them for their natural variations that they have literally no control over. It undermines the very concept of biological diversity and ignores the complex realities of human physiology, which is something that the Gender Critical Theory in its base simplicity just does not take into account.

110,96,756,91,24616,@TheEbonyMaw,Maw,8s,"Deleted my first tweet about the “transgender Olympic boxer” because many people gold me that she’s not trans. She’s “intersex”.

So I did some digging. And so far here’s what I’ve got:

“Is Imane Khelif intersex?” 
Almost every article I’ve read (& I’ve opened up about 20+ at this point) essentially says “Imane Khelif has never identified as trans or intersex”. They never get more specific than that. 
EVERY SINGLE NEWS ARTICLE I’ve read doesn’t confirm her gender, nor specifies what condition she might have. The only places where I’ve heard she’s trans, or female, or has some condition, or anything else is from Twitter.

“If Khelif is not a biological male, what’s the problem with her competing?” 
Khelif failed a gender test done by the IBA (International Boxing Association) for the 2023 World Boxing championship. All articles I’ve read say she failed the test because of elevated testosterone levels, because she has XY chromosomes, or both.

“If she failed gender tests in the World Boxing championship, why can she box the Olympics?” 
Because the Olympics doesn’t listen to the IBA. They do their own tests, & claim Khelif passed those tests.

“If Khelif is biologically female, why does she have elevated testosterone levels & XY chromosomes?”
Despite no actual news article specifying why this might be, I’ve found multiple non-news articles that say she has “HYPERANDROGENISM”, a condition when present in females produces high levels of testosterone & XY chromosomes.

That’s all I got. Hope this helps. I guess.",delet my first tweet about the transgend olymp boxer becaus mani peopl gold me that shes not tran shes intersex so i did some dig and so far here what ive got is iman khelif intersex almost everi articl ive read ive open up about 20 at this point essenti say iman khelif has never identifi as tran or intersex they never get more specif than that everi singl news articl ive read doesnt confirm her gender nor specifi what condit she might have the onli place where ive heard shes tran or femal or has some condit or anyth els is from twitter if khelif is not a biolog male what the problem with her compet khelif fail a gender test done by the iba intern box associ for the 2023 world box championship all articl ive read say she fail the test becaus of elev testosteron level becaus she has xy chromosom or both if she fail gender test in the world box championship whi can she box the olymp becaus the olymp doesnt listen to the iba they do their own test claim khelif pass those test if khelif is biolog femal whi doe she have elev testosteron level xy chromosom despit no actual news articl specifi whi this might be ive found multipl nonnew articl that say she has hyperandrogen a condit when present in femal produc high level of testosteron xy chromosom that all i got hope this help i guess,neutral,0.8007558584213257,"[{'entity': 'MISC', 'word': 'Olympic'}, {'entity': 'PER', 'word': 'Imane Khelif'}, {'entity': 'PER', 'word': 'Imane Khelif'}, {'entity': 'PER', 'word': 'Khelif'}, {'entity': 'PER', 'word': 'Kif'}, {'entity': 'ORG', 'word': 'IBA'}, {'entity': 'ORG', 'word': 'International Boxing Association'}, {'entity': 'MISC', 'word': 'World Boxing'}, {'entity': 'MISC', 'word': 'World Boxing'}, {'entity': 'MISC', 'word': 'Olympics'}, {'entity': 'ORG', 'word': 'Olympics'}, {'entity': 'ORG', 'word': 'IBA'}, {'entity': 'PER', 'word': 'Khelif'}, {'entity': 'PER', 'word': 'Khelif'}, {'entity': 'MISC', 'word': 'H'}]"

The question isn't about trans athletes competing in sports in this specific scenario - it's about a person that was born with female genitalia but with an XY chromosome, like a man would've.

This has given the person in question a visible advantage in the things that matter most in sports - larger frame, more muscle mass, and in things that can't be seen with higher testosterone and other factors.

Putting aside what the right gender it is to call this person, in the spirit of fair sport, what happened today doesn't represent fairness IMO.

Sports are highly regulated for a reason - to maximize fairness between combatants and to minimize the chance of injury or death due to unfair advantages.

This is why I do not support the cross-over of people born as men - strictly speaking XY chromosome with male genitalia - that choose to transition and compete as women.

This has given them unquestionable advantages that are simply not fair. I think these folks should either compete in their own league of transgender athletes, or in the league that they were born in.

However, in this specific scenario, as long as the above is true, it's a little bit more complex. In the end the question is around fairness.

At first glance it does not feel to me that a person born with an XY chromosome, which ends up getting all the advantages of said chromosome in sport, should be allowed to compete in women's sports.

Men have natural advantages vs women when it comes to physical attributes - muscle mass, size, reaction speed, twitch muscles, etc. The XY vs XX chromosome is the best tool we have to decide who will get these benefits.

I think what gender this person should be referred as is a much less important issue, and I don't think it's a big deal if this person wants to be referred to as a woman due to the genitalia she was born with. This is a non-issue IMO.

However, safety and fairness in sport is much more important, and in rare cases like these, it's important to ensure we have a level playing field.

Some might bring up the example of natural freaks like Mike Tyson in his prime - he was dominating absolutely everyone in his weight class and was a physical freak of nature.

The important distinction here is that Mike Tyson had the same chromosome make up as the rest of the field and very likely had the same level of testosterone. Within the bounds of what he was born with, he excellent above everyone else.

In this case, there's a natural advantage that doesn't exist in the rest of the field and is impossible to access if you are born with a XX chromosome - unless you partake in some serious illegal activity by using Performance Enhancing Drugs.

That's my take - tell me where I'm wrong.",re women olymp box match that taken the internet by storm the question isnt about tran athlet compet in sport in this specif scenario it about a person that was born with femal genitalia but with an xy chromosom like a man wouldv this has given the person in question a visibl advantag in the thing that matter most in sport larger frame more muscl mass and in thing that cant be seen with higher testosteron and other factor put asid what the right gender it is to call this person in the spirit of fair sport what happen today doesnt repres fair imo sport are high regul for a reason to maxim fair between combat and to minim the chanc of injuri or death due to unfair advantag this is whi i do not support the crossov of peopl born as men strict speak xy chromosom with male genitalia that choos to transit and compet as women this has given them unquestion advantag that are simpli not fair i think these folk should either compet in their own leagu of transgend athlet or in the leagu that they were born in howev in this specif scenario as long as the abov is true it a littl bit more complex in the end the question is around fair at first glanc it doe not feel to me that a person born with an xy chromosom which end up get all the advantag of said chromosom in sport should be allow to compet in women sport men have natur advantag vs women when it come to physic attribut muscl mass size reaction speed twitch muscl etc the xy vs xx chromosom is the best tool we have to decid who will get these benefit i think what gender this person should be refer as is a much less import issu and i dont think it a big deal if this person want to be refer to as a woman due to the genitalia she was born with this is a nonissu imo howev safeti and fair in sport is much more import and in rare case like these it import to ensur we have a level play field some might bring up the exampl of natur freak like mike tyson in his prime he was domin absolut everyon in his weight class and was a physic freak of natur the import distinct here is that mike tyson had the same chromosom make up as the rest of the field and veri like had the same level of testosteron within the bound of what he was born with he excel abov everyon els in this case there a natur advantag that doesnt exist in the rest of the field and is imposs to access if you are born with a xx chromosom unless you partak in some serious illeg activ by use perform enhanc drug that my take tell me where im wrong,neutral,0.7618114352226257,"[{'entity': 'MISC', 'word': 'Olympic'}, {'entity': 'MISC', 'word': 'XY'}, {'entity': 'MISC', 'word': 'XY'}, {'entity': 'MISC', 'word': 'XY'}, {'entity': 'MISC', 'word': 'XY'}, {'entity': 'MISC', 'word': 'XX'}, {'entity': 'PER', 'word': 'Mike'}, {'entity': 'PER', 'word': 'Tyson'}, {'entity': 'PER', 'word': 'Mike'}]"

She was banned at the World Championships because of the unfair advantage her genetic disorder (DSD) gives her. Transgender surgeries are outlawed in Algeria, it has also been verified that her passport identifies her as a female. 

In March 2023, Khelif was disqualified for failing to meet eligibility criteria shortly before her gold medal bout at the 2023 IBA Women's World Boxing Championships. 

The Algerian Olympic Committeesaid Khelif was disqualified for medical reasons. It was later reported that the disqualification was due to high levels of testosterone.

According to International Boxing Association president Umar Kremlev, DNA testing of Khelif and other athletes ""proved they had XY chromosomes and were thus excluded from the sports events""

There is speculation that Khelif may not be transgender but has a disorder of sex development (DSD), which causes some females to have XY chromosomes and blood testosterone levels typical of a male.

If she couldn’t qualify at the World Championships, I don’t believe she should in the World Olympics but she isn’t a man, as for Angela Carini, she was robbed but she has also been crying since 2021.

The clash between Angela Carini and her Algerian opponent Imane Khelif lasted just 46 seconds, with Carini yelling 'this is unjust' before she fell to canvas.

Khelif was thrown out of last year's world championships after failing testosterone tests carried out to establish gender qualification.

But despite her gender test problems, she was admitted to the Olympics. 

Olympics officials at Paris 2024 have accepted her as a female and state so in her official games biography.

The fight is now set to become one of the most controversial in Olympic history.

Khelif is not a biological man, she is a woman with a high level of testosterone and was disqualified from the world championship last year due to concerns over that matter and failing to meet the eligibility criteria. She does not have the XY chromosomes instead of XX as the circulating claims.
Her case is similar to South Africa’s middle-distance runner and two-time Olympic gold medalist Caster Semenya (2012 & 2016) who has had a high level of testosterone in her body and was subjected to tough rules from the IOC to take testosterone-reducing medications and was banned from some races until she meets the allowed level. Please do read about Semenya if you have no clue about her story.
There has been a dispute between the IOC and the World Boxing Association regarding the participation of Khelif and Lin Yu-ting of Taiwan who has a similar case at #Paris2024
The talks should be about whether she is allowed to compete or not due to the high level of testosterone and not accusing her of being a man.
Just wanted to make this clear after seeing the story being shared thousands of times on social media.

For a long time I've been annoyed at the Hollywood portrayal of the bad-ass fighting woman. Women as small as Scarlett Johansson are shown being able to physically defeat men three times her size. 

The debacle of this week's Olympic boxing match between a man and a woman reveals the lie: even an average-trained man can destroy an elite-trained woman in physical combat. 

This is why it's an age-old custom in almost every culture in history that a man should never hit a woman, and that women should not be engaged in physical combat of any kind.
